LW Bits is a package to help you with your Livewire projects. The HTML 5 elements as defined by [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) are available as Livewire components.

The package is designed to be as flexible as possible. You can use the components as they are, or you can extend them to add your own functionality.

The attributes that are available for each component are the same as the attributes that are available for the HTML 5 element. Read more of the in-depth documentation on each component and/or Attribute Trait for more information.
